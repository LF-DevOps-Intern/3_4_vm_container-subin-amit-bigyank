#### 2. Explain Working mechanism of Containers.

In simple terms, a container is a package that contains all that is required within a single unit. Containers in IT, which use the similar concept, contain all of the essential dependencies as well as the code. This makes setting up the environment, whether for development or deployment, quite simple. Unlike virtual machines, the container engine isolates programs from one another. We may concentrate less on how to manage dependencies and other intricacies that may arise during the setup process.
