#### 3. What problem does Virtualization solves and what is its drawback in context to modern application deployments?

Virtualization solves the following issue:

- Virtual machines (VMs) make it simple to grow applications and manage variable workloads, which is why virtualization is so important in cloud computing.
- Virtual machines (VMs) provide separated environments, allowing many operating systems and applications to run on a single server. Without having to deal with contention concerns or purchasing several servers to handle different environments, organizations may install legacy and business applications in the environments they need.
- VMs are also popular among businesses because of the additional degree of security they give against potential threats. A VM can be removed or rolled back to a recent backup or snapshot if it has been hacked. The threat is limited to that VM because it is isolated from the host and other VMs.

Virtualization's disadvantage:

- When a VM is allocated to a resource, it takes up the entire space, even if it only requires a small amount of it.
- Virtual machines are software chunks the size of gigabytes. The programs are run on a virtual machine that is extremely reliant on the operating system and simulated hardware.
