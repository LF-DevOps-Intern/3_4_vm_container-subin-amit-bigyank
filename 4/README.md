#### 4. What are the problems Container solves in regard to app deployment and how it solves?

When it comes to app deployment, containers can help with issues like:

- Retrieving application images and starting isolated instances of each application process is simple with the container engine and command line tool.
- Containers make agile development easier to follow and allow programs to be deployed, patched, and scaled more quickly.
- Containerization aids in the packaging of applications and their dependencies into portable application images that can be distributed to artifact repositories and subsequently executed on container hosts.
